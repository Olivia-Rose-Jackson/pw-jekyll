# Effective File Managment
When creating an effective filing system, you want to aim for consistancy and consision. File names should not include spaces, stick to dashes and underscores while avoiding special characters. Keep a consitant format throughout. Determine which aspects of your files your naming convention should cover. This could be date (DDMMYY) or document version (v01) or who/what the document was written for (class/name)


For example:
## No nameing convention 
- Note for Maria
- Research Paper 2025
- Book Brainstorm
## Nameing convention
- 001_LiteracyNotes_Maria_v01
- 002_ReadersResearch_ENG412_v01
- 003_ReadersResearch_ENG412_v02
- 004_BookBrainstorm_ENG395_v01
